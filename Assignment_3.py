#--------------- Q 1 ----------------------------------------------------

'''Keywords are the reserved words that can not
be used as a variable, function or any other identifier.
Examples - 1. for 
           2. in
           3. is
           4. break
           5. continue  '''

#---------------- Q 2 ----------------------------------------------------
# ---- Rules for defining identifiers---------------

'''
1. Identifiers cannot be a keyword.
2. It can have a sequence of letters and digits.
3. We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, and so on.
4. Identifiers are case-sensitive.

''' Comments in Python are the lines in the code that are ignored by
the interpreter during the execution of the program. 
Comments increase understandibility and readbility in a piece of code
'''
'''Example - 
1. Single line comment :--- # Its a single line comment'''
'''2. Multi line comment :--- ''' ''' its a 
                                        multi line comment'''

# -------------- Q 4 --------------------------------------------------------

''' In python Indentation represents a block of code which is to be executed according to usage.
For example 

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
    if i == 4:
        pass
print("executed")         
    
in the above code print statement and if condition is in the loop that represents a whole 
block of code and second print statement is out of the loop or out of code block which is
decided by indentation '''

# --------------------------- Q 5 -------------------------------------------

''' If indentation is incorrect  then code will not be executed, interpreter will show error'''

# ---------------------------- Q 6 --------------------------------------------

'''
An Expression is a sequence or combination of values, variables, operators and function
calls that always produces or returns a result value
Example :-- x = y + 5

Any Instruction that a python interpreter can execute (carry out) is called a Statement.
x = 5
print(x)'''
